NAME
====
mvc - a simple MVC library implemented in JavaScript.

DESCRIPTION
===========
This is a simple JavaScript based MVC library.

I started writing this because I needed a standalone, compact, simple, trusted MVC implementation for the purposes
of implementing [passwords](http://github.com/jonseymour/passwords). 

DISCLAIMER
==========
Yes, I could have used some other library, but I haven't done this for several reasons. Most other libraries out there
are attempting to solve bigger problems that I need to solve. Also, I am relatively new to idiomatic JavaScript
so I wanted to use this hone my JavaScript skills by creating an MVC library from scratch.

Oh yeah, it isn't even close to working yet...I am still experimenting with it.
